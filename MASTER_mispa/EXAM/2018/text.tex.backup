\sujet{Bone age}

Definition from Wikipedia: bone age is the degree of maturation of a child's bones. The bones of the skeleton change in size and shape as a person grows. These changes can be seen by x-ray. The "bone age" of a child is the average age at which children reach this stage of bone maturation.

The most commonly used method is based on a single x-ray of the left hand, fingers, and wrist (see Fig.\ref{fig:mispa:exam_2018:radio}).
