  Abstract                 = {The logarithmic image processing (LIP) model is amathematical framework based on abstract linear mathematicswhich provides a set of specific algebraic and functionaloperations that can be applied to the processing of intensityimages valued in a bounded range. The LIP model has been provedto be physically justified in the setting of transmitted lightand to be consistent with several laws and characteristics ofthe human visual system. Successful application examples havealso been reported in several image processing areas, e.g.,image enhancement, image restoration, three-dimensional imagereconstruction, edge detection and image segmentation.},
