  abstract = {Summary The logarithmic image processing (LIP) model is a mathematical
	framework which provides algebraic and functional operations for
	the processing of intensity images valued in a bounded range. The
	LIP model has been proved to be physically consistent, most notably
	with some image formation models and several laws and characteristics
	of human brightness perception. This paper addresses the image focus
	measurement problem using the LIP model. The three most classical
	image focus measurements: the sum-modified-Laplacian, the tenengrad
	and the variance, which aim at estimating the degree of focus of
	an acquired image by emphasizing and quantifying its sharpness information,
	are considered and reinterpreted using the LIP framework. These reinterpretations
	notably make attempts at evaluating degrees of focus in terms of
	human brightness (sensation) from physical light stimuli. Their potential
	is illustrated and validated on shape-from-focus issues on both simulated
	data and real acquisitions in digital optical microscopy. The concept
	of shape-from-focus involves recovering the shape of an observed
	thick sample by locally maximizing a focus measurement throughout
	a sequence of differently focused images. Finally, it is shown that
	the LIP-based focus measurements clearly outperform their respective
	classical ones.},
