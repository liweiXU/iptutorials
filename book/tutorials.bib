  Abstract                 = {The development of stereological methods for the study of dilute phases of particles, voids or organelles embedded in a matrix, from measurements made on plane or linear intercepts through the aggregate, has deserved a great deal of effort.With almost no exception, the problem of describing the particulate phase is reduced to that of identifying the statistical distribution---histogram in practice---of a relevant size parameter, with the previous assumption that the particles are modelled by geometrical objects of a constant shape (e.g. spheres). Therefore, particles exhibiting a random variation about a given type of shape as well as a random variation in size, escape previous analyses. Such is the case of unequiaxed particles modelled by triaxial ellipsoids of variable size and eccentricity parameters. It has been conjectured (Moran, 1972) that this problem is indetermined in its generality (i.e. the elliptical sections do not furnish a sufficient information which permits a complete description of the ellipsoids). A proof of this conjecture is given in the Appendix. When the ellipsoids are biaxial (spheroids) and of the same type (prolate or oblate), the problem is identifiable. Previous attempts to solve it assume statistical independence between size and shape. A complete, theoretical solution of the spheroids problem---with the independence condition relaxed---is presented.A number of exact relationships---some of them of a striking simplicity---linking particle properties (e.g. mean-mean caliper length, mean axial ratio, correlation coefficient between principal diameters, etc.) on the one hand, with the major and minor dimensions of the ellipses of section on the other, emerge, and natural, consistent estimators of the mentioned properties are made easily accessible for practical computation.Finally, the scope and limitations of the mathematical model are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The logarithmic image processing (LIP) model is a mathematical framework which provides algebraic and functional operations for the processing of intensity images valued in a bounded range. The LIP model has been proved to be physically consistent, most notably with some image formation models and several laws and characteristics of human brightness perception. This paper addresses the image focus measurement problem using the LIP model. The three most classical image focus measurements: the sum-modified-Laplacian, the tenengrad and the variance, which aim at estimating the degree of focus of an acquired image by emphasizing and quantifying its sharpness information, are considered and reinterpreted using the LIP framework. These reinterpretations notably make attempts at evaluating degrees of focus in terms of human brightness (sensation) from physical light stimuli. Their potential is illustrated and validated on shape-from-focus issues on both simulated data and real acquisitions in digital optical microscopy. The concept of shape-from-focus involves recovering the shape of an observed thick sample by locally maximizing a focus measurement throughout a sequence of differently focused images. Finally, it is shown that the LIP-based focus measurements clearly outperform their respective classical ones.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of microscopy images of corneal endothelium is routinely carried out at eye banks to assess cell density, one of the main indicators of cornea health state and quality. We propose here a new method to derive endothelium cell density that, at variance with most of the available techniques, does not require the identification of cell contours. It exploits the feature that endothelium cells are approximately laid out as a regular tessellation of hexagonal shapes. This technique estimates the inverse transpose of a matrix generating this cellular lattice, from which the density is easily obtained. The algorithm has been implemented in a Matlab prototype and tested on a set of 21 corneal endothelium images. The cell densities obtained matched quite well with the ones manually estimated by eye-bank experts: the percent difference between them was on average -0.1\% (6.5\% for absolute values). Albeit the performances of this new algorithm on the images of our test set are definitely good, a careful evaluation on a much larger data set is needed before any clinical application of the proposed technique could be envisaged. The collection of an adequate number of endothelium images and of their manual densities is currently in progress.},

We review some examples and focus on some details of an emerging new methodology that starts from some continuous models provided by PDEs and proceeds with discrete processing of the image data via the numerical implementation of these PDEs on some discrete grid. We examine the PDEs modeling multiscale morphological image analysis and the related eikonal PDE of optics. The PDE approach is very promising because it provides many new mathematical models and has connections with the physics of imaging},

The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the `no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: The problem of automatic estimation of endothelial cell density from microscopy images in donor corneas was addressed. Methods: The spatial frequencies contained in digital endothelium images are extracted with a two dimension discrete Fourier transform (DFT) technique. A circular band in the DFT of the images is shown to contain the frequency information related to the cell density. An algorithm for reliably recovering this spatial frequency information and for extracting from it an estimate of endothelial cell density has been developed and implemented in a computer program. An evaluation was performed on a data set containing 100 donor corneas, by comparing automatic values with manual counts performed by three eye bank experts on two images for each cornea. Results: The mean difference of automatic densities v manual ones was 14 cells/mm2 (0.9\%), with a standard deviation of 119 cells/mm2 (5.1\%) and mean absolute difference of 92 cells/mm2(3.9\%). The ANOVA based overall inter-rater reliability was 0.935. The algorithm was also capable of identifying all non-processable images. Running times were in the order of 1-2 seconds per image. Conclusion: A new algorithm was developed for the fully automatic estimation of endothelial cell density. The results of a clinical evaluation on 100 corneas suggest that it is capable of reliably estimating endothelium cell density in donor corneas.},

An evaluation of its repeatability was performed on a data set containing 200 corneas, by assessing accuracy and precision of automatic vs. manual values. For each cornea, between 2 and 21 images (1536 total) at 100x for automatic ECD and one image at 200x for manual ECD were available. Results: Accuracy of automatic ECDs was -45 {+/-} 99 cells/mm2 (-2\% {+/-} 4\%). Precision of repeated automatic ECDs on the same cornea was 62 {+/-} 30 cells/mm2 (3\% {+/-} 1\%).

  abstract = {Images in fluorescence microscopy are inherently blurred due to the limit of diffraction of light. The purpose of deconvolution microscopy is to compensate numerically for this degradation. Deconvolution is widely used to restore fine details of 3D biological samples. Unfortunately, dealing with deconvolution tools is not straightforward. Among others, end users have to select the appropriate algorithm, calibration and parametrization, while potentially facing demanding computational tasks. To make deconvolution more accessible, we have developed a practical platform for deconvolution microscopy called DeconvolutionLab. Freely distributed, DeconvolutionLab hosts standard algorithms for 3D microscopy deconvolution and drives them through a user-oriented interface. In this paper, we take advantage of the release of DeconvolutionLab2 to provide a complete description of the software package and its built-in deconvolution algorithms. We examine several standard algorithms used in deconvolution microscopy, notably: Regularized inverse filter, Tikhonov regularization, Landweber, Tikhonov–Miller, Richardson–Lucy, and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding. We evaluate these methods over large 3D microscopy images using simulated datasets and real experimental images. We distinguish the algorithms in terms of image quality, performance, usability and computational requirements. Our presentation is completed with a discussion of recent trends in deconvolution, inspired by the results of the Grand Challenge on deconvolution microscopy that was recently organized.},

The transformation replaces the gray level value at a point by either the minimum or the maximum of gray levels in its neighborhood, the choice depending on which one is closer in value to the original gray level. It is shown that after a finite number of iterations, the image stabilizes to one in which every point is either a local maximum or else a local minimum. The ability of several iterations of the transformation to restore white-black crispness in a fuzzy image is shown both analytically and by example.},
