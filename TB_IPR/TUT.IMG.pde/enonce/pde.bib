  Abstract                 = {Most traditional methodologies in digital image processing start with a discrete model which is directly related to the subsequent discrete processing of the image data. We review some examples and focus on some details of an emerging new methodology that starts from some continuous models provided by PDEs and proceeds with discrete processing of the image data via the numerical implementation of these PDEs on some discrete grid. We examine the PDEs modeling multiscale morphological image analysis and the related eikonal PDE of optics. The PDE approach is very promising because it provides many new mathematical models and has connections with the physics of imaging},

  Abstract                 = {A new definition of scale-space is suggested, and a class of algorithms used to realize a diffusion process is introduced. The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the `no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image},
