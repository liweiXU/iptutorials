\section{Granulométrie (10 points)}
The following 2-D image represents a set of discs whose grain size (size distribution) has to be determined. %La difficulté réside dans la connectivité de certains disques. En effet, certaines composantes connexes représentent des amas de plusieurs disques connectés, que nous souhaitons donc  individualiser pour faciliter la caractérisation. 
\begin{figure}[h]

{\includegraphics[width=5cm]{disks.png}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{qbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up a procedure to determine the number of disks.
\item Let us consider that this disk population is composed of two size classes. Determine the number of discs for each class.
\end{itemize}
\end{qbox}

\section{Geometric covariogram (10 points)}
The geometric covariogram of a convex set $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by the following application:
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma_K(u)=A(K\cap (K+u))
\end{eqnarray} 
where $u$ is a vector of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A$ is the area measure.\\
The following figure illustrates the covariogram of a rectangle $K$ for a certain vector $u$ :
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[] (0,0)--(3,0)--(3,2)--(0,2)--(0,0);
\draw[] (1,1)--(4,1)--(4,3)--(1,3)--(1,1);
\draw[fill=gray] (1,1)--(3,1)--(3,2)--(1,2)--(1,1);
\draw[->] (0,0)--(1,1);
\node at (0.95, 0.5) {$u$};
\node at (-0.5, 1) {$K$};
\node at (5, 2) {$K+u$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\noindent Often we are interested in the isotropic covariogram $\overline{\gamma}_K(r), r\in \mathbb{R}$ as the average of $\gamma_K(ru)$ on all possible directions $u\in S^1$ (uniform distribution on the disc $S^1$).\\
Although it is often difficult to obtain an explicit formula for $\overline{\gamma}_K(r)$, one have analytical expression for some elementary sets K. For example, for a disc with a radius of $R$, its isotropized covariogram is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{\gamma}_K(r)=2R^2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r}{2R}\right)-\frac{\sqrt{4R^2-r^2}}{2}, \textrm{ pour } 0\leq r \leq 2R \label{eq:cov_disc}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{qbox}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulate a disc with a radius of $R$ and numerically calculate its isotropic covariogram. Notice that \minline{meshgrid} could be useful to generate a binary image of a disc.
\item Compare your estimated covariogram with the analytical covariogram via Eq.\ref{eq:cov_disc}.
\item By repeating this procedure for discs of different radii, plot the relative error between the two covariograms (estimated and analytical) as a function of the $R$ radius of the disc.
\end{itemize}
\end{qbox}
