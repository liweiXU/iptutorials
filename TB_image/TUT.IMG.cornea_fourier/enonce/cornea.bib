  Abstract                 = {The analysis of microscopy images of corneal endothelium is routinely carried out at eye banks to assess cell density, one of the main indicators of cornea health state and quality. We propose here a new method to derive endothelium cell density that, at variance with most of the available techniques, does not require the identification of cell contours. It exploits the feature that endothelium cells are approximately laid out as a regular tessellation of hexagonal shapes. This technique estimates the inverse transpose of a matrix generating this cellular lattice, from which the density is easily obtained. The algorithm has been implemented in a Matlab prototype and tested on a set of 21 corneal endothelium images. The cell densities obtained matched quite well with the ones manually estimated by eye-bank experts: the percent difference between them was on average -0.1% (6.5% for absolute values). Albeit the performances of this new algorithm on the images of our test set are definitely good, a careful evaluation on a much larger data set is needed before any clinical application of the proposed technique could be envisaged. The collection of an adequate number of endothelium images and of their manual densities is currently in progress.},

  Abstract                 = {Aims: The problem of automatic estimation of endothelial cell density from microscopy images in donor corneas was addressed. Methods: The spatial frequencies contained in digital endothelium images are extracted with a two dimension discrete Fourier transform (DFT) technique. A circular band in the DFT of the images is shown to contain the frequency information related to the cell density. An algorithm for reliably recovering this spatial frequency information and for extracting from it an estimate of endothelial cell density has been developed and implemented in a computer program. An evaluation was performed on a data set containing 100 donor corneas, by comparing automatic values with manual counts performed by three eye bank experts on two images for each cornea. Results: The mean difference of automatic densities v manual ones was 14 cells/mm2 (0.9%), with a standard deviation of 119 cells/mm2 (5.1%) and mean absolute difference of 92 cells/mm2(3.9%). The ANOVA based overall inter-rater reliability was 0.935. The algorithm was also capable of identifying all non-processable images. Running times were in the order of 1-2 seconds per image. Conclusion: A new algorithm was developed for the fully automatic estimation of endothelial cell density. The results of a clinical evaluation on 100 corneas suggest that it is capable of reliably estimating endothelium cell density in donor corneas.},

  Abstract                 = {Background/aims: The repeatability of an automatic system for estimation of endothelial cell density (ECD) from microscopy images in donor corneas was assessed. Methods: A computer program for the automatic ECD estimation from frequency analysis was previously presented. An evaluation of its repeatability was performed on a data set containing 200 corneas, by assessing accuracy and precision of automatic vs. manual values. For each cornea, between 2 and 21 images (1536 total) at 100x for automatic ECD and one image at 200x for manual ECD were available. Results: Accuracy of automatic ECDs was -45 {+/-} 99 cells/mm2 (-2% {+/-} 4%). Precision of repeated automatic ECDs on the same cornea was 62 {+/-} 30 cells/mm2 (3% {+/-} 1%). The algorithm was also capable of identifying all non-processable images. Conclusion: The proposed automatic technique proved to be reliable for its routine use in a typical eye-bank setting like the one considered here.},
