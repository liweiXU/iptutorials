\begin{note}This practical work aims to investigate image segmentation with a direct application to o\-va\-rian follicles. The overall objective is to extract and quantify the granulosa cells and the vascularization of each follicle included in an ewe's ovary.
\end{note}

\noindent The image to be processed is a 2D histological image of an ewe's ovary acquired by optical microscopy in Fig.\ref{fig:follicle:enonce:parts}. The presented image contains one entire follicle (the white region and its neighborhood) and a part of a second one (right-upper corner). The follicle is composed of different parts shown in: antrum, granulosa cells and vascularization. The theca is the ring region around the antrum where the follicle is vascularized.

\section{Vascularization}
\vspace*{-10pt}
\begin{qbox}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Load and visualize the image.
	\item Extract the antrum of the follicle.
	\item Extract the vascularization (inside a ring around the antrum).
\end{itemize}
\end{qbox}

\section{Quantification}
\vspace*{-10pt}
\begin{qbox}
Provide some geometrical measurements of the different entities of the follicle (antrum, vascularization, granulosa cells).
